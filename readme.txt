Records the performance of your wp hosting server, display graphs of the server response, and end user web page load speeds

== Description ==

This plugin will record the performance of your wp Hosting company.

Ever noticed your site seems to perform OK when you check, but other folk say its slow later. Like gremlins are getting in and making it slower ? 

It's often difficult to know how your wp web site is performing, and how real end users are experiencing the performance of your wp web site.

This plugin will display graphs of the performance of the server (so you'll be able to see what the gremlins are doing).

It also tracks performance of the web page load speed, which includes all the assets jpg/png/css/js.

You'll be able to view graphs for different periods of time, to see how your server is performing, and how real world users are observing the performance of your wp site.

You'll be able to observe when the server is sluggish, or when it is fast.

It is designed to run async, so any performance hit is after the end user's web page has finished loading. This should result in no impact to your WordPress website delivering pages.

It also has a feature to email you when the server reponse becomes unacceptably slow.

* New Features
- ability to benchmark your current hosting against other hosting companies
- technology index - to give you an idea of how good/poor the technology your WordPress site is running on
- artifical benchmark of php and mysql (on the sysinfo page for now).

== Installation ==


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. the plugin will start working straight away.
4. Use the wp Hosting Performance Check -> Settings sccreen to configure the plugin
5. log out of WordPress. And go surf a few pages of your site.
6. log back into /wp-admin/ , and observe your wp Hosting Performance Check stats.
7. [optional] install 'GeoIP detection' plugin, and this plugin will track the country of the visitors. You can check that the GeoIP plugin is working in the settings of eiter this plugin, or the geoip plugin. I recommend you install a local copy of the geomind database through the settings of the geoip plugin. https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/ 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= will it slow my site down ? =

No.
We do an ajax request asyncronously. So after the page loads, it sends a short request.

= will it make my database slow ? =

we've taken reasonable steps to not slow the database.
we have no indexes on the table, so inserts are fast.
we prune the table to only keep the last 30 days.

= does it log admin users ? =

no , we ignore all logged in users.

= does this use some sort of web whacking to test the site performance ? =

no, it records the real hits from real users and web crawlers.

= it says there is no data to display =

this plugin logs realtime users, and excludes logged in users. So log out of WordPress, and surf your site a little.

= Does it work with caching ? =

It works reasonably with full page caching. 
You'll need to clear your cache after installing the plugin.
You can cache bust to test yourself, just add ?r3we4 to the end of your page name, just some random junk after the question mark - will make it so the cache doesn't work.

== Screenshots ==

1. a few of the graphs. This shows a tally (or distribution) of the main 2 timings that are tracked. The first graph shows end users real world web browser load speed. This is a combination of the server, and how the page is designed. The second gaphs shows the pure response time of the hosting server

2. this screen shot is giving you a quick indication of how well your wp hosting server performance is doing. Green zone is good, you don't want it being in the red zone.
